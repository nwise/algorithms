* Chapter 1
** Binary Search
*** O(log n) - # of operations double as input squares (Binary Search)
*** O(n) - # of operations increases linearly (Simple Search)
*** O(n!) - # of operations is a factorial of input (Traveling Salesman)

* Chapter 2
** Arrays v Linked Lists
| Operation | Array | List |
| Reading   | O(1)  | O(n) |
| Insertion | O(n)  | O(1) |
| Deletion  | O(n)  | O(1) |
** SelectionSort
*** O(n * n )

* Chapter 3
** Recursion
*** Recursive operations with a tall stack can be memory intensive
*** Consider Tail Recursion

* Chapter 4
** Divide & Conquer to break down a list
** QuickSort O(n log n)
** Constant can matter sometimes in Big O

* Chapter 5
** Hash Tables
*** Goal of O(1) lookup
